        <h1>How To Choose The Right Colours For Your Home?</h1>
        <p>Whether you want your home to emit a calm vibe or create an energetic atmosphere full of vigour and zest, colours play a vital role in setting up a home by creating the desired ambience and atmosphere that reflect the inhabitants’ personalities and style preferences.</p>
        <h2>How to choose colours for your interiors?</h2>
        <p>The use of complementary colours can create a visually pleasing and harmonious space and you can make the right call by referring to the simple colour wheel that we learnt in school. “Red, yellow, and blue are primary colours. Combining any of these will give you a secondary colour i.e. purple, orange, etc. Colours near each other on the colour wheel such as blue and purple are analogous to each other and will allow one colour to stand out more. Colours opposite to each other on the colour wheel such as green and red are complementary to one another and will nicely play off each other,” explains Charu Gupta, interior designer and director of L’ Institute De Dessins.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Limit the number of colours:</strong>When it comes to colour, less is more. Having fewer colours is the key. Try to keep one colour in the centre and build the rest around it as a strategy. This helps create a balanced palette.</li>
            <li><strong>Choice of light vs. dark: </strong>Lighter colours make spaces look bigger, open, and airy, while darker tones make the space cosier and more compact. When it comes to the choice of the mood board, one needs to see the requirement of their own space. If there is more natural light and higher ceilings, one can choose a bit darker palette. If the space is small, one must opt for whites or lighter tones to make the room look spacious.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility of space:</strong>Common areas of homes by default would warrant a more peaceful and calming colour palette, whereas spaces such as the cigar rooms, lounges and home theatre areas need a cosier vibe. These areas can have some darker colours introduced to add that effect.</li>
        </ul>
